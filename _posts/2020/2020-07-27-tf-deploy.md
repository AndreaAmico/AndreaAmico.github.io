## Setup python environment (Ubuntu 20.04)

Get `pip` and `virtualenv` installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
```
Create a new environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv tf
source tf/bin/activate
```

Install the `tensorflow` library and, if needed, `opencv`:
```bash
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```


## Tensorflow lite
If there is no need to train models, a tansorflow lite environment can be used by itself. One needs to select the correct version from [this list](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python) and install it. For example on Ubuntu 20.04 64bit:
```bash
pip3 install https://dl.google.com/coral/python/tflite_runtime-2.1.0.post1-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl
```

The tensorflow interpreter can now be used as follows:
```python
import tflite_runtime.interpreter as tflite
interpreter = tflite.Interpreter(model_path=args.model_file)
```


## Coral usb accelerator
First install the coral dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install curl

echo "deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt coral-edgetpu-stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/coral-edgetpu.list

curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt-get update
```

Finally install the coral library. There are two version available, the **standard** and the **max** version, which is faster but the usb device gets hot really fast. **NB: only one version can be installed in the system. Installing a different one will override the previous.**
```bash
# standard:
sudo apt-get install libedgetpu1-std

# max:
sudo apt-get install libedgetpu1-max
```
