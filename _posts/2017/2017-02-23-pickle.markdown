Use example of [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html "https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html") library to store data.


To store `data_to_save` in `"my_file.pkl"` just:
{% highlight python %}
import pickle
with open("my_file.pkl", 'wb') as output_file:
	pickle.dump(data_to_save, output_file)
{% endhighlight %}

To load from the pickle file:
{% highlight python %}
import pickle

with open("my_file.pkl", 'rb') as pkl_file:
	my_loaded_data = pickle.load(pkl_file)
{% endhighlight %}
