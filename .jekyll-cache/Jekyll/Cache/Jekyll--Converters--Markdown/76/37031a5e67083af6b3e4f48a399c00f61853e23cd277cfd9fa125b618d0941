<p>Problem-solving is what I enjoy the most. I have a scientific mindset and a great passion for programming. During my PhD studies I published on top scientific journals and I worked with world-leading scientists including the Nobel Laureate Professor Wolfgang Ketterle.
Iâ€™m now interested in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
