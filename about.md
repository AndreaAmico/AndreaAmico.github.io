Problem-solving is what I enjoy the most. I have a scientific mindset and a great passion for programming. During my Ph.D. studies I published in top scientific journals and I worked with world-leading scientists including the Nobel Laureate Professor Wolfgang Ketterle. Iâ€™m now interested in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
