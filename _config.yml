  I'm just too lazy to use dropbox or github to copy paste code for everyday science scripts.
  Need to fit some cute data points? Need to analyse your favoutite images?
  Need 20 lines of code to write a trash gui you will use for a couple of weeks? 
  I hope not, infact i write it for me. If you want to steel something, feel free to copy-paste at your own risk,
  you will probably find a forest of bugs.
